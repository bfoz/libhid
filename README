Introduction
============

libhid is a cross-platform C++ library for interacting with [USB Human Interface Devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class).

Installation
============

git submodule
-------------

To use libhid as a submodule in your project's git repository:

   git add submodule git://github.com/bfoz/libhid.git *path*

where *path* is the path to put the submodule (relative to your repository root). Then follow the instructions below for linking the library into your project.

Linking
=======

Qt / qmake
----------

Simply include libhid.pri in your project's .pro file. qmake will take care of the rest.

Example
=======

Here is a simple example that finds a device by it's Product ID and Vendor ID, opens the device, and then sends a simple output report.

	#include <hid.h>

	HID::filter:And filters;
	filters.push_back(new VendorID(VENDOR_ID));
	filters.push_back(new ProductID(PRODUCT_ID));

	HID::device_list devices = HID:find(&filters);
	if( devices.size() )
	{
	    HID::device_type& device = devices.front();
	    HID::buffer_type buffer;
	    device.output(REPORT_ID, buffer);
	}
